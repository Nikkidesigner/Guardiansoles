Developed an IoT-based emergency womenâ€™s shoe.
Utilized ESP32 for sending distress signals, Neo 6M for GPS tracking, and a lithium-ion battery for power. 
A push button activates the distress signal, which is sent to a mobile app.
The app uses Google Maps API to convert raw data into live location tracking and sends a notification soundwhen activated.
